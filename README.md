# Pizza-Sales-Analysis- SQL
Analyzed a pizza company's sales data to uncover key trends and insights using advanced SQL techniques. SQL-Based Pizza Store Data Analysis Project

Excited to share my latest SQL project where I dived into real-world datasets from a pizza store to uncover key business insights—from customer preferences to sales and revenue trends.

🍕 Project Overview: I worked with four core datasets: pizza_types, pizza, orders, and order_details, performing deep-dive analysis across Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced SQL concepts.

📊 Key Insights Extracted: ✔️ Total orders and overall revenue ✔️ Highest-priced pizza on the menu ✔️ Top 5 most frequently ordered pizzas ✔️ Category-wise demand distribution ✔️ Order trends by hour and day ✔️ Revenue share by pizza type ✔️ Cumulative revenue using window functions

🧠 Skills Demonstrated:

Advanced SQL joins and aggregations

Grouping and filtering for trend identification

Window functions for cumulative metrics

Business intelligence mindset for insight generation

🎯 Impact: This project strengthens my Data Analyst skillset and showcases how SQL can turn raw data into meaningful and actionable business insights.
